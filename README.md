## Introduction

Just wanted to test ourselves with certain technologies and decided a video upload site would be the best way to include the use of them. 

## Project Approach

Spent lots of time on slack throughout the day and met quite regularly on zoom to do the equivalent of standup and to merge code.

## Main Features
1. Registration and login

2. Upload Video
   - User is able to upload videos
4. Edit Video

   - User will not be able to delete videos made by other users

8. Like/Dislike feature

## User Journey Map
-  I think can create a slideshow with the pages of site like  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRxvfFPhro095iSjXvhexmGfgjIFfppQVHhWzHhiUXL0f11tWhS1TUpGyILHF6_2vUudr50FVFREjcn/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000
